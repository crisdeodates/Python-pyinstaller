Extend the ``module_collection_mode`` setting from :issue:`6945` to also
apply to modules collected into ``base_library.zip`` archive. Implement
discovery of source .py files for modules in ``base_library.zip`` at
run-time. This allows collection and discovery of source .py files for
modules in ``base_library.zip``, which might be required by frameworks
that perform aggressive recursive introspection all way down to standard
library modules (for example, ``torch`` JIT in combination with certain
model implementations).
