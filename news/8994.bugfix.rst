When constructing ``PyiFrozenFinder`` for the given path and trying
to compute the path that is relative to the top-level application
directory, do not fully resolve the given path. Instead, try computing
relative path using both the original and the fully resolved top-level
application directory path. This change prevents us from potentially
resolving symbolic links in parts of the given path that do not belong
to the top-level application directory.
